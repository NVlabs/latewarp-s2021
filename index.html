<h1>Gaming at Warp Speed: Improving Aiming With Late Warp</h1>

<p>This project includes a demonstration of late warp techniques, commonly used in VR for image stablization realtive to head position, for ego-centric/first-person gaming.</p>
<p class="note"> For more information check out our <a href="https://research.nvidia.com/publication/2021-08_Gaming-at-Warp">NVResearch Project Page</a></p>

<hr>

<h2>Instructions</h1>
<p>Our demo can be used in one of two modes:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="?">Experiment mode</a> - A set of trials designed to demonstrate the impacts of latency on first-person aiming and the improvement offered by a simple late warp</li>
<li><a href="?">Sandbox mode</a> - A free exploration mode with many additional settings, including rendering, player, target, and scene parameters</li>
</ul>

<p>
    The complete experiment should take about <b>5 minutes</b> to complete.
    Try your best to complete all trials in <b>minimum time</b> with the <b>highest accuracy</b> you can achieve.
</p>

<p class="note">At the end of the set of experiment mode trials, the application automatically transitions to sandbox mode (the page can be reloaded to repeat the experiment)</p>

<hr>

<h2>Experiment Mode</h2>
<p>
    In experiment mode the application begins with a training session in which the user can set their mouse sensitivity (using the up and down arrow keys, or by pressing escape and using a slider) and familiarize themselves with the environment.
    Upon visiting the <a href="?">experiment mode link</a> provided above, a  welcome screen greets the user.
</p>

<h3>Training Session</h3>
<p>
    The experiment welcome screen outlines the basic control interface and prompts the user to click to enter fullscreen mode and begin interacting with the experiment training session.
    Once the user clicks on this screen the application should become fullscreen (or display a message if your browser does not support this) and provide the following view.
</p>
<p class="note">You can return to this screen at any time by pressing the escape key </p>

<p> The training session is intended to familiarize users with the experience and type of targets they will be asked to destroy in the following trials. </p>
<p> In this view moving the mouse left and right will rotate the view azimuth (yaw) angle while moving the mouse up and down will rotate the view elevation (pitch) angle. </p>

<img src="images/StartOfTraining.png" alt="Start of Training" style="width:48%">

<p> Training begins when the user left clicks on the red reference target, destroying it and spawning the first moving training target. </p>
<p> During training the user can adjust their mouse sensitivity at any point by using the keyboard <b>up/down arrows</b>, or by pressing escape and using the cursor to adjust the "Mouse Sensitivty" slider located at the top of the screen. </p>
<p class="note"> Feel free to take a break following training if you'd like one </p>

<h3>Measurement Sessions</h3>

<p>    Once the user has successfully destroyed all training targets another red reference target will spawn indicating the start of the measured trials.</p>

<p> There are a total of <b>3 trial conditions</b> presented in the experiment:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Low latency condition (no added delay)</li>
    <li>High latency condition (added delay)</li>
    <li>High latency condition with warp correction</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Each condition consists of the same number of trials.
    Try to do your best to maintain both <b>high accuracy</b> and <b>minimal time</b> in every condition.
</p>

<p>
    Depending on how fast you rotate the view, you will likely notice <i>guardband artifacts</i> in the late warp condition. 
    These show up as black areas at the edge(s) of the screen and represent information missing from the original render that isn't filled in by our warp and are expected.
    Try your best to maintain your performance in spite of these visual artifacts.
</p>

<p>
    Upon completing the experiment you will be presented with a summary of their performance in all 3 conditions.
    This data is not logged by the application and only presented by this display.

<p> This window will close when the user presses <b>Shift</b> on the keyboard, and the experiment will automatically transition to sandbox mode. </p>
<p class="note"> If you'd like to repeat the experiment you can reload the page or revisit <a href="?">the link provided above</a></p>

<hr>

<h2>Sandbox Mode</h2>
<p>In <a href="?">sandbox mode</a> the user can openly interact with the application's configuration through a menu without a need to complete the experiment provided by <a href="?">experiment mode</a>.</p>
<p>In sandbox mode the user may destroy as many targets as they like in any given condition, with a score "banner" at the top of the screen keeping track of:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Total targets destroyed since a reset</li>
    <li>Average time between targets destroyed</li>
    <li>Overall accuracy</li>
</ul>

<p>To reset these statistics the user can press the <b>R</b> key on their keyboard at any time.</p>

<h3>Sandbox Mode Configuration</h3>
<p>
    To interact with this menu the user can press escape (if in fullscreen mode) and use the cursor to click on the drawers to expand them and view their contents.
    From within these drawers many of the application parameters are exposed.
